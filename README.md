# AI-usage-Dependency-Analysis


This project aims to analyze how students engage with generative AI tools in academic contexts, specifically distinguishing between those who use AI as a support tool and those who exhibit signs of dependency. The study is based on survey data collected from students across diverse academic backgrounds, featuring Likert-scale responses on AI usage frequency, self-reported dependency, and cognitive habits. Three classification approaches were implemented: threshold-based scoring on dependency items, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for pattern visualization, and K-Means clustering for unsupervised grouping. The project includes detailed steps for data preprocessing, classification logic, cluster analysis, and statistical testing (independent sample t-tests) to identify significant differences in usage behavior. The overall findings suggest that while some students demonstrate dependency traits, the majority use AI tools to enhance learning without compromising academic effort.
